# biomapper2

![CI](https://github.com/Phenome-Health/biomapper2/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

This is a package for mapping **biomedical entities** to the KRAKEN knowledge graph, whether starting from text names or vocabulary/ontology IDs (local IDs or CURIEs).

It supports both **single-entity** lookups and **dataset-level** batch processing, and does:

1. **entity linking** (text name → CURIE)
2. **ID normalization** (messy local ID → CURIE)
3. **entity resolution** (CURIE → canonical CURIE, by leveraging the CURIE equivalencies in the KRAKEN knowledge graph)

All CURIEs are represented in [Biolink](https://github.com/biolink/biolink-model/tree/master/src/biolink_model/prefixmaps)-standard format.

⚠️ **Note**: This package is in active development. Feedback and issues welcome!

### Quick access via PyPI

If you just want to **map entities against the hosted production API** without running your own server, install the lightweight client package:

```bash
pip install ddharmon
```

See [ddharmon on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ddharmon/) for usage. It wraps the same REST API documented below, pointed at the production Kestrel instance.

## Setup

### Install uv (if not already installed)

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

For other platforms, see [uv installation docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### Clone and install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Phenome-Health/biomapper2.git
cd biomapper2
uv sync --dev
```

This will create a virtual environment and install all dependencies.

Then create a `.env` file from the template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
The defaults work as-is: `KESTREL_API_URL` points at the public Kestrel, which needs no key. Set `KESTREL_API_KEY` only if you switch to the internal endpoint. The file also contains optional API authentication settings — see the comments in `.env.example` for details.

Then [run the pytest suite](#run-tests) to confirm all is working.

## Usage

### Map a single entity to knowledge graph

```python
from biomapper2.mapper import Mapper

mapper = Mapper()

item = {
    'name': 'carnitine',
    'kegg': ['C00487'],
    'pubchem': '10917'
}

mapped_item = mapper.map_entity_to_kg(
    item=item,
    name_field='name',
    provided_id_fields=['kegg', 'pubchem'],
    entity_type='metabolite'
)
```

### Map a dataset to knowledge graph

```python
from biomapper2.mapper import Mapper

mapper = Mapper()

mapper.map_dataset_to_kg(
    dataset='data/examples/olink_protein_metadata.tsv',
    entity_type='protein',
    name_column='Assay',
    provided_id_columns=['UniProt'],
    array_delimiters=['_']
)
```
See `examples/` for complete working examples.

## REST API

biomapper2 includes a FastAPI server that exposes the mapping pipeline over HTTP.

### Run the server

```bash
# Local development (with hot reload)
uv run uvicorn biomapper2.api.main:app --reload --port 8001

# Or via Docker
docker compose --profile prod up -d
```

The API docs are available at:
- **Swagger UI**: http://localhost:8001/api/v1/docs
- **ReDoc**: http://localhost:8001/api/v1/redoc
- **OpenAPI spec**: http://localhost:8001/api/v1/openapi.json

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | `/api/v1/health` | Health check (no auth required) |
| GET | `/api/v1/entity-types` | List supported entity types |
| GET | `/api/v1/annotators` | List available annotators |
| GET | `/api/v1/vocabularies` | List supported vocabularies |
| POST | `/api/v1/map/entity` | Map a single entity |
| POST | `/api/v1/map/batch` | Map multiple entities (max 1000) |
| POST | `/api/v1/map/dataset` | Map an uploaded TSV/CSV file |
| POST | `/api/v1/map/dataset/stream` | Stream mapping results as NDJSON |

### Raw Kestrel passthrough (`kestrel_top_n`)

`kestrel_top_n` is an opt-in request option that returns the top-N **raw** rows Kestrel returned for
each search endpoint the pipeline actually used, alongside the normal result, so downstream consumers
can audit why a `chosen_kg_id` won or inspect near-misses without re-querying Kestrel.

**`candidate_limit` vs `kestrel_top_n` — they are not the same knob:**

| Option | What it controls | Can it change `chosen_kg_id`? |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| `candidate_limit` | The **selection window** — how many candidates each Kestrel search annotator retrieves and re-ranks. | **Yes.** Widening the window can change which node wins. |
| `kestrel_top_n` | **Passthrough only** — how many raw rows are returned in `kestrel_results`. | **No.** `chosen_kg_id`, `assigned_ids`, the resolver vote, and the certificate are byte-identical across any `kestrel_top_n` (including `None`). |

Details:

- Set on the request body for `/map/entity` and `/map/batch` (`options.kestrel_top_n`, 1..100), or as a
  query param on `/map/dataset/stream`. **`/map/dataset` (non-streaming) rejects it with a 422** — it
  returns a TSV path, not per-entity JSON, so use `/map/dataset/stream`.
- The response carries `kestrel_results`: one entry per used endpoint, each with the exact `request`
  params, the raw `rows` (Kestrel's order, truncated to N, **before** the hybrid `score>=0.5` filter and
  any re-ranking), `fetch_strategy` (`separate_call`), and a classified `error` (`timeout` |
  `upstream_error` | `malformed_response` | `other`) when that endpoint's passthrough call failed. A
  passthrough failure never turns a successful mapping into an error, and empty when the entity made no
  Kestrel call.
- **Rows are untrusted external data** (passed through verbatim, not biomapper-attested) — any renderer
  must treat every field as unescaped.
- **Payload cap:** the worst case is `len(entities) × kestrel_top_n × 3 endpoints` raw rows
  (e.g. `1000 × 100 × 3 = 300,000`). `/map/batch` and `/map/dataset/stream` hard-enforce a cap
  (`KESTREL_PASSTHROUGH_MAX_ROWS`, default 100,000 worst-case rows) and reject an over-cap request with
  a 422; reduce `kestrel_top_n` or the batch size, or page the request.

Example (single entity, 10 raw rows per used endpoint):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/v1/map/entity \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "glucose", "entity_type": "metabolite", "options": {"kestrel_top_n": 10}}'
```

### Authentication

Set `BIOMAPPER_API_KEY` or `BIOMAPPER2_API_KEYS` (comma-separated) in your `.env` file to require API key authentication via the `X-API-Key` header. If no keys are configured, the API runs in open-access mode.

## Docker

### Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # defaults to the keyless public Kestrel; edit only to change endpoints

docker compose --profile prod up -d
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/health
```

### Development

```bash
# Start with live code reload (mounts src/ and tests/)
docker compose --profile dev up

# Run tests inside the container
docker compose --profile dev run --rm biomapper2-dev uv run pytest -m "not integration" -v

# Run quality checks
docker compose --profile dev run --rm biomapper2-dev ./scripts/check.sh
```

### Building manually

```bash
docker build --target prod -t biomapper2 .       # Production image
docker build --target dev -t biomapper2:dev .     # Development image
```

### Generate KG-performance across datasets
```python

from biomapper.visualizer import Visualizer

viz = Visualizer()

# collect metrics from jsons named {dataset}_{entity}_MAPPED_a_summary_stats.json
stats_df = viz.aggregate_stats(
    stats_dir='data/examples/synthetic_stats/'
)

viz.render_heatmap(
    df=stats_df,
    output_path='docs/assets/comparison_viz' # defaults to producing pdf and png, configurable via Visualizer(
)
```

### Configuration

Environment variables (set in `.env`):
- `KESTREL_API_URL` - Knowledge graph API endpoint. Defaults to the public Kestrel
  (`https://kestrel.krakenkg.com/api`), which requires no key. Point it at
  `https://kestrel.nathanpricelab.com/api` for the internal endpoint, which serves a
  different KRAKEN build. `GET $KESTREL_API_URL/metagraph` reports the graph and version.
- `KESTREL_API_KEY` - API key for the Kestrel API (required only by the internal endpoint;
  the public one ignores it)

Additional settings in `src/biomapper2/config.py`:
- `BIOLINK_VERSION_DEFAULT` - Default Biolink model version
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Logging verbosity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)

## Future work

Known follow-ups, mostly around the cross-repo build-provenance chain (KRAKEN
`build_info.json` → Kestrel `/health` → biomapper2 `run_provenance`):

- **Cross-repo round-trip test.** Each repo tests its own leg of the provenance chain in
  isolation; the schema-drift guard in KRAKEN is the only thing tying them together. A
  committed golden `build_info.json` fixture, shared and asserted in all three repos,
  would catch a field that is spelled consistently in the schema but consumed wrongly.
- **Wire up the `kg_regression` marker.** It is registered (`pyproject.toml`) but unused —
  the `kg-regression.yml` workflow currently runs the whole correctness suite against a
  candidate KG. Marking a focused subset would let regression runs target just the tests
  that detect KG-version drift.
- **Populate `node_count` / `edge_count`.** These are reserved in
  `kraken/build_info.schema.json` and surface in `run_provenance`, but KRAKEN does not yet
  emit them (they serialize as `null`). Wiring them in would give analysts graph-scale at a
  glance.
- **Pre-1.0 release cadence.** release-please currently bumps the minor on every `feat:`
  (0.1.0 → 0.2.0 → …). If we'd rather keep features as patch bumps until a deliberate 1.0,
  set `bump-patch-for-minor-pre-major` (and `bump-minor-pre-major`) in each repo's
  `release-please-config.json`.
