"""Live merge-gate validation: human genes/proteins must resolve into the correct human-gene clique.

Marked `integration` (hits the live Kestrel API). Runs the full pipeline via Mapper.map_entity_to_kg
with the default-on prefer_human behavior, asserts each gold entity resolves to a KG node whose
equivalent-id clique contains the expected human NCBIGene **and** an HGNC marker, and persists a
timestamped report (per the experiment-artifact SOP).

Two classes of positive case:
- Search-recoverable (TNFRSF1A/TNFRSF1B/LDLR): the human node is in the candidate set and `prefer_human`
  re-ranking selects it; `chosen_kg_id` is the exact NCBIGene. The TNFRSF1A/TNFRSF1B pair exercises the
  paralog guard.
- Drug-conflated (GH1/CALCA/POMC/CRH/CTLA4/GBA1): the human node is unreachable by any Kestrel search
  (conflated into a drug node), so it resolves only via the curated gene-symbol fallback bridge. The
  bridge assigns the right NCBIGene, but the KG's canonicalize step then collapses it into its
  over-merged clique whose *representative* is a drug/chemical node (CALCA -> CHEBI:3306 "calcitonin",
  GH1 -> UNII:NQX9KB6PCL "SOMATROPIN"). So `chosen_kg_id == NCBIGene:X` is unsatisfiable for these — the
  achievable, biologically-correct assertion is that the chosen node's clique *contains* the expected
  NCBIGene (verified live 2026-06-18: those clique nodes carry both the NCBIGene and an HGNC equivalent).
