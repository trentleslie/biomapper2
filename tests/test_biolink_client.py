"""Offline/caching guarantees for BiolinkClient — the fix for the flaky offline gate.

bmt.Toolkit downloads the model schema (when given a URL) and the predicate map on every
construction. The offline test gate builds a fresh ``Normalizer()``/``Mapper()`` per case, so those
downloads ran hundreds of times and flaked on transient GitHub-raw resets ("Connection reset by
peer"). BiolinkClient now (1) disk-caches the schema and (2) builds the Toolkit once per process.
These tests pin both, plus the download retry that absorbs a single transient failure.

Network is only touched to warm the process-wide cache once (the single build the whole suite
shares); every assertion below runs against the cached, offline path.
