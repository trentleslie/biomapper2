"""NIST SRM 1950 / SRM1950-DB adapter (metabolite arm — structure oracle).

SRM1950-DB (Mandal et al. 2025, Anal. Chem., DOI 10.1021/acs.analchem.4c05018) is the certified
NIST SRM 1950 human-plasma reference set — 1,058 metabolites at srm1950-data.wishartlab.com. The
CSV delivery (metabolites.csv) ships ``HMDB_ID``, ``NAME``, ``SMILES`` and ``INCHIKEY`` columns,
but at acquisition the **INCHIKEY column is empty** while SMILES is ~95% populated.

Design mirrors ``necs_metabolon`` (small enough to load in full) with ONE acquisition-driven
difference: the independent structure-oracle InChIKey is **derived from the certified SMILES** via
RDKit (deterministic, standard cheminformatics; zero shared infra with BioMapper's resolver) when
the delivery's INCHIKEY column is empty. An explicit INCHIKEY (should a future delivery populate
it) is preferred verbatim. Rows whose SMILES fails to parse (or is absent) yield no gold structure
and are retained as coverage-only — excluded from the accuracy denominator by the scorer.

Network is isolated behind ``fetch_supplement`` so the transform is fully unit-testable offline.
