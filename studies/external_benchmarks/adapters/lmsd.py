"""LMSD (LIPID MAPS Structure Database) adapter (metabolite/lipid arm — structure oracle).

LMSD is the LIPID MAPS Structure Database, governed by Liebisch et al. 2020 (J. Lipid Res.,
DOI 10.1194/jlr.S120001025 — the LIPID MAPS shorthand nomenclature). The bulk SDF download
(``lipidmaps.org/files/?file=LMSD&ext=sdf.zip``, CC BY 4.0, ~50k curated records) ships per
record a lipid **shorthand ``ABBREVIATION``** (e.g. ``PC 16:0/18:1``), a common ``NAME``, a
``SYSTEMATIC_NAME``, the ``INCHI_KEY`` + ``SMILES``, and a crosswalk to PubChem/HMDB/KEGG/ChEBI/
SwissLipids. This targets BioMapper's KNOWN lipid weakness (NIST SRM 1950 lipids scored only
40.3%) with an honest gap-characterization on lipid NAME inputs.

Design mirrors ``refmet`` (a large, streamed, reservoir-subsampled structure-oracle arm), with the
LMSD-specific transforms:

  - **Structure oracle = LMSD's own ``INCHI_KEY``** (first block, charge-normalized via the record's
    SMILES). Preserved verbatim; the crosswalk IDs are coverage only. Only BioMapper's *prediction*
    is ever resolved (in the scorer) — the gold InChIKey never touches the resolver.
  - **NAME input, LM_ID held out (contamination control).** The query handed to BioMapper is a lipid
    *name* whose structure must be inferred — the per-row best-available of ``ABBREVIATION`` (lipid
    shorthand) -> ``NAME`` (common) -> ``SYSTEMATIC_NAME``. The ``LM_ID`` is NEVER a query and NEVER
    the oracle; it is carried only as a held-out provenance column (``held_out_lm_id``). Because the
    Kestrel KG recognizes the LIPIDMAPS namespace, scoring on LM_IDs would be circular — so we score
    on names, whose structure BioMapper must resolve independently.
  - **Streaming + reservoir subsample** (like ``refmet``): the SDF is streamed record-by-record,
    filtered to the InChIKey-bearing population (``require_gold_structure`` — the oracle needs a
    held-out structure), deterministically reservoir-subsampled (``seed`` pinned), and the exact
    scored subset is PERSISTED beside the card (the download is a mutable "current release", so
    URL+seed+n alone cannot reconstruct it).

Network is isolated behind ``stream_sdf_lines`` so the SDF parse + subsample + card transforms are
fully unit-testable on an in-memory line iterator.
