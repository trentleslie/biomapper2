"""Independent external resolver for the curator's HELD-OUT provided ids -> InChIKey first-block.

Oracle (b)'s GOLD side must NOT share infrastructure with the KG structure oracle that resolves
BioMapper's PREDICTION -- otherwise the "structural concordance" is circular (both sides resolved by
the same Kestrel KG). This resolves the curator's HMDB / PubChem provided id to an InChIKey first-
block via **PubChem PUG-REST**, an external source independent of the KG. It is:

  - CACHED (per (namespace, id); repeated ids across rows cost one call),
  - IPv4-FORCED (reuses the adapter's ``force_ipv4`` -- the desktop's IPv6->CDN route is flaky), and
  - FAIL-SOFT per id: any non-200 / network error / unparseable body yields ``None`` (cached) so the
    scorer marks that row ``needs-verification`` rather than silently dropping it or fabricating a
    block.

PubChem endpoints used (property/InChIKey, TXT for a single bare value):
  - PubChem CID:  ``/compound/cid/{cid}/property/InChIKey/TXT``
  - HMDB accession (xref RegistryID): ``/compound/xref/RegistryID/{hmdb}/property/InChIKey/TXT``

Lipid oracle (provided-id path). Metabolon shorthand lipid NAMES do not resolve via PubChem-by-name
(and are neither a pygoslin dialect nor a LIPID MAPS abbreviation -- both probed at 0% coverage on the
real refused names). But the cohort source carries curator cross-reference ids (HMDB / PubChem CID /
InChIKey). ``block_for_provided`` resolves those ids -- KG-independent, since BioMapper commits via
name / RM / CHEBI, not via these HMDB/PubChem ids -- and tags each result with its provenance so the
certificate can enforce disjointness (Unit 2). It also distinguishes a transient ``lookup_failed`` from
a genuine ``clean_miss`` so a network blip is never silently counted as ``refused``.
