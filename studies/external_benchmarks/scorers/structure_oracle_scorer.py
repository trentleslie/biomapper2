"""Unit 3 — comparable-core scorer: structure-oracle Top-1 accuracy.

Correctness is adjudicated by InChIKey *connectivity* (first block), never by identifier
identity. The gold block comes from the dataset's own curated InChIKey column (no resolver,
zero shared infra with the SUT — the circularity guard). Only BioMapper's *prediction*
(``chosen_kg_id``) is resolved through the KG structure oracle.

A prediction whose ChEBI id differs from gold but shares connectivity is CORRECT; a
prediction with different connectivity is INCORRECT. Rows whose gold has no InChIKey are
excluded from the accuracy denominator but still counted in coverage. Rows whose predicted
structure had to come from the name fallback (not the KG record) are flagged into a
segregation bucket so a reviewer can see how many corrects leaned on the fallback path.
