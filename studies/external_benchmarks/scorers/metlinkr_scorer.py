"""metLinkR dual scorer — TWO labelled oracles for the same-task cross-linking head-to-head.

metLinkR (Patt et al. 2025) reports AGREEMENT with the COMETS expert curators (~85.3%) and does NOT
validate its links against an InChIKey structural oracle. This scorer emits BOTH, never merged:

  (a) CURATOR-AGREEMENT rate — metLinkR's own metric. Over the curator's cross-DATASET linked pairs
      (two rows the curators placed in the same ``Manual_Metabolite_Group_Label`` but that came from
      DIFFERENT COMETS datasets), the fraction that BioMapper ALSO links: its two independently
      name-resolved canonical-identifier sets intersect (``curie_scorer.predicted_curies``). The
      curator grouping is HELD OUT of BioMapper's input, so a link is non-trivial — BioMapper must
      arrive at the same canonical for both members from the NAME alone. This is a link RECALL on
      the curator's asserted cross-links (the ~85.3%-comparable number); a count of BioMapper links
      the curators did NOT assert (potential over-linking) is reported for context, never merged.

  (b) INCHIKEY STRUCTURAL CONCORDANCE — the oracle metLinkR LACKS (BioMapper's differentiator). For
      each row carrying a HELD-OUT curator/Metabolon provided reference id (HMDB / PubChem), resolve
      BioMapper's name-chosen id through the KG oracle AND resolve the curator id through an
      INDEPENDENT external source (PubChem PUG-REST — see ``scorers/independent_inchikey.py``), then
      compare the two InChIKey first-blocks. Because the GOLD side does not share infrastructure with
      the prediction side, the concordance is NOT circular. This asks whether BioMapper's LINK is
      structurally right, not merely identifier/name-consistent.

Discipline (Hajjar/NECS/MetaboliteAnnotator learnings):
  - TWO numbers, each labelled; the coverage-shaped curator-agreement is NEVER merged with the
    structural-concordance correctness qualifier.
  - ANTI-TRIVIAL: both oracles are held out; ``assert_curator_held_out`` re-checks (fail-loud) that
    the curator grouping / provided-id columns are present-for-the-scorer-only and are NOT the query.
  - FAIL-LOUD on unscorable: a run with zero curator cross-pairs AND zero structural rows raises
    rather than reporting a hollow rate.
  - INDEPENDENT GOLD SIDE: oracle (b) resolves the curator id through an EXTERNAL resolver (PubChem
    PUG-REST) that is independent of the KG structure oracle used for the prediction, so the
    concordance is not circular (the earlier shared-KG-oracle approach is retained only as a legacy
    fallback when no ``independent_resolver`` is supplied, and self-labels a shared-infra caveat).
    Rows the external source cannot cover are counted as ``needs_verification`` — excluded from the
    concordance denominator and reported, never silently dropped or resolved via the KG instead.
