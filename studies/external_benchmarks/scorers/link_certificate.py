"""Unit 5 — KG-independent structural certificate for a cross-cohort link.

A link is asserted by CURIE-set intersection (Unit 2), i.e. because both cohorts' metabolites
resolved — via the SAME Kestrel KG — toward an intersecting CURIE. Certifying that link by reading
that same KG node's InChIKey would be **circular**: a shared CURIE mechanically implies a shared
KG-InChIKey, so the certificate would carry no information (the exact Deliverable-1 failure:
"reads KRAKEN's own InChIKey first ... NOT KG-independent").

So this module certifies a link ONLY by comparing two structures that are each resolved
**independently of the KG node that formed the link** (R6a):

  - NECS side   : the repaired gold InChIKey / SMILES (Deliverable 1).
  - cohort side : ``independent_inchikey`` (PubChem PUG-REST) from the cohort's vendor id.

The API deliberately never accepts the linking CURIE's KG-node InChIKey. A link whose cohort side
has no independent structure (BLSA sum-composition, LLFS formula/mass, or a PubChem lookup failure)
is **REFUSED** — counts-only — never certified off the KG (R6b). Refusal is a first-class verdict.

Certificate key = ``block1 + "-" + block2[:8]`` (block-1 alone merges 11 groups this domain must
keep apart). When a side carries only a first-block InChIKey (the PubChem resolver's current
granularity), the comparison degrades to connectivity-only and says so (``stereo_checked=False``) —
never a silent stereo pass.

Pure/offline: it operates on InChIKey strings passed in. Resolving the cohort-side InChIKey from
vendor ids (network) is the caller's gated step; tests pass keys directly / monkeypatch the fetch.
