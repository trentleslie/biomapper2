"""Unit 3 — Hajjar native match-rate.

Reported *alongside* the comparable core, never merged with it. Hajjar's native metric is
a per-input match-rate: the fraction of input names for which a target-vocab identifier was
produced. This is a coverage-shaped number and is labeled with input_type=name so it is
never mistaken for the structure-oracle accuracy.
