"""Tier B: independent structure evidence for a QUERY NAME. Opt-in, default-off.

What this is for
----------------
Tier A is a *self*-certificate: it reports what the graph asserts about the node the pipeline
committed. That is free and honest, but it cannot corroborate or refute the choice, because both
sides come from the same graph. Tier B resolves the **query name** -- the string the user handed in,
not the node's name -- against an external registry, so a verdict can be independent of the
selection.

Why it is off by default
------------------------
Turning it on moves external calls from a small conflict subset to every unique query name across
every benchmark arm. That is a real cost against rate-limited services, and it changes the meaning
of the emitted state, so it is a decision an operator makes deliberately per run rather than a
default the pipeline drifts into. ``config.TIER_B_ENABLED`` is the switch and a test asserts it is
False.

Independence is a per-row property, not a property of the tier (L26)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The first hop is Metabolomics Workbench, which is the same registry the RefMet annotator queries to
produce the candidate the resolver source-weights toward. On rows where RefMet supplied the
committed node, Tier B via MW asks RefMet whether RefMet was right. The hop is kept for coverage,
but ``certificate.issue`` computes ``independent_of_selection`` and the published curve is
stratified by source, so independence is claimed only where it holds.

Guarded, throttled, and accounted
---------------------------------
The fetchers are called through this wrapper rather than directly: the swallow-everything
``try/except`` in ``StructureResolver.inchikey_block`` does not cover them, so a ``raise_for_status``
on a 503 would propagate into the mapping loop. Failures degrade to ``lookup_failed``, which is kept
distinct from ``unresolvable`` -- a throttled service is a property of the network, and collapsing
the two would turn an operating curve into an artifact of the run. ``stats()`` reports the tier's own
resolution rate, which must accompany every operating point: the endpoints here are EXACT-name
lookups while the annotator uses a fuzzy match, so corroboration is otherwise computed on a biased
easy subset.
