"""Curated, non-search fallback for human gene nodes that Kestrel search cannot surface.

A small set of human genes whose protein product is a marketed therapeutic are conflated by the
upstream Translator/Babel layer into a single node named for the drug (e.g. GH1 -> the SOMATROPIN
node). The node still carries the gene symbol as a synonym and an HGNC equivalent, but it never ranks
for the gene symbol in any Kestrel search modality, so `prefer_human` re-ranking can never reach it.

This resolver is a deterministic, non-search bridge: for the curated symbols only, it returns the
canonical human NCBIGene CURIE, accepting it only after `/get-nodes` confirms the node carries the
queried symbol as a synonym AND an HGNC equivalent (so it cannot inject a wrong-but-human gene). It is
a no-op for every other symbol. This is a temporary measure; the durable fix is upstream (Kestrel-side
exact-symbol retrieval / de-conflation). See docs/plans/2026-06-17-001-feat-gene-symbol-fallback-resolver-plan.md.
