"""
One-to-many resolution module for selecting single KG nodes.

Resolves cases where multiple KG nodes match an entity by selecting the best candidate.
For small-molecule ChEBI conflicts the naive curie-count vote is source-weighted toward the
RefMet (``metabolomics-workbench``) annotator under an InChIKey-connectivity guard, so the
common protonation/stereo variant conflict is fixed while genuine divergences are flagged
for review rather than committed silently.
