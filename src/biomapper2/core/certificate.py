"""The resolution certificate: what the graph asserts about a committed node, and what refutes it.

Why this module exists
----------------------
Before it, the resolver computed a structural verdict inside ``Resolver._choose_best_kg_id`` and
discarded it. The only thing that escaped was ``chosen_kg_id_review``, a flag string whose ``None``
covered several distinct situations, so a consumer could not tell "the graph asserts a structure for
this answer" from "the graph asserts nothing and we cannot check". The certificate makes that
distinction a first-class, emitted object.

The one rule this module must never get wrong (L21)
---------------------------------------------------
``structure_absent`` is **unverifiable**, not wrong. A committed node the graph lists no InChIKey for
cannot be ``contradicted``, because there is nothing to contradict it with; it is ``unavailable``.
Publishing a precision gain for refusing that bucket would be a claim no oracle can support -- see
the artifact field ``sparsity_control.n_absent_oracle_could_fire`` in
``studies/analysis/certificate_state_audit.py``, which is the admissibility test for any such claim.
``issue`` enforces the rule structurally (``contradicted`` is reachable only from
``structure_present``) and ``tests/test_resolution_certificate.py`` asserts it over the full input
cross-product.

Two tiers
---------
**Tier A** is the default and is **zero-I/O**. It reads ``kg_equivalent_ids["INCHIKEY"]`` -- the
structure the *graph* asserts for the node the pipeline already committed -- and nothing else. It
deliberately does NOT use ``StructureResolver.inchikey_blocks``: that helper falls through to
Metabolomics Workbench and PubChem *by name* when the KG lists no key, i.e. on exactly the
``structure_absent`` population, which would fire an external request per absent row and silently
reclassify some of them as ``structure_present`` from a non-KG source. The two look interchangeable
in a diff and are not: ``inchikey_blocks`` answers "what structure can I find for this node by any
means", Tier A answers "what structure does the GRAPH assert for this node". Only the second is a
self-certificate, and only the second is free.

**Tier B** is opt-in and default-off. It resolves the *query name* against an independent registry
and can refine ``structure_present`` into ``corroborated`` / ``contradicted``. It never moves a row
off ``unavailable`` or ``not_applicable``.

``issue`` is pure and I/O-free on purpose, so the state table can be tested without a network.
