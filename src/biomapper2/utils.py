    Separated from :func:`_bisect_chunk` so a chunk whose failure has already been observed is
    never resubmitted verbatim. Resubmitting it wastes a request against a service that has just
    returned an error, and on a flaky backend it can succeed by luck, which would end the bisect
    with the wrong conclusion.

    Make Kestrel API requests with automatic batching for large payloads.

    Splits batch_items into chunks, makes separate API calls for each chunk,
