# "…measurement" nodes) and by Protein/Gene typings.
#
# No figure is restated here on purpose. Every number behind this policy is emitted by
# `studies/analysis/off_category_audit.py` into its committed artifact under
# studies/analysis/results/; read the fields rather than a comment that can drift:
#   - metabolite_total / per_dataset  — the off-category rate, and how much of it each dataset carries
#   - off_category_composition_by_category — which Biolink types dominate the refused population
#   - protein_gene_refusal_cost — what the guard COSTS: whether any refused node was the right compound
#     wearing a wrong Biolink type (the peptide-metabolite worry: glutathione/carnosine/gamma-glutamyl-X)
#   - adjudicator_positive_control — proof that the cost measurement could have found a nonzero answer
#
# Semantics, and note the two sides are expanded *separately*:
#   - The KEY is expanded via get_descendants so subcategories of a configured job category inherit the

#   - The VALUE is the acceptance ROOT and is expanded via get_descendants on its own. It is deliberately
#     one level up from the key: descendants('biolink:ChemicalEntity') is 12 categories, so a legitimately
#     broader typing (ChemicalEntity, MolecularMixture, Drug) survives while Protein/Polypeptide/
#     PhenotypicFeature/Pathway/MolecularActivity do not.
#
# Gene/protein are intentionally absent, and the gene arm is the control that proves why: nearly every
# hgnc commit is "off-category" relative to a chemical root, exactly as it should be (artifact field
# per_dataset.hgnc). Pointing a chemical acceptance set at the gene path would refuse almost all of it,
# so that path stays unfiltered. Any category with no entry here is likewise unfiltered — including the
# biolink:NamedThing that standardize_entity_type falls back to for an unrecognized entity type.
